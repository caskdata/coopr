=============
Upgrade Guide
=============
.. _upgrade-guide:

This guide describes how to upgrade Continuuity Loom. Upgrades follow the general process 
of stopping Loom services, taking a backup of all state in the database, running one or 
more upgrade scripts, and starting back up all Loom services. 

0.9.6/0.9.7 to 0.9.8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* 1 - Stop Loom services

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-provisioner stop
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-ui stop
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-server stop

* 2 - Stop Database and take a backup

  * The embedded Derby database is stopped when Loom Server is stopped
  * If you are using the embedded Derby database, perform the following
     * Replace ``/var/loom/data`` below with the location from ``loom.local.data.dir`` in ``/etc/loom/conf/loom-site.xml`` if you have modified it from default

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo cp -R /var/loom/data /var/loom/data.backup

  * If you are using another database, such as MySQL, follow your standard procedures for backing up the Loom database

* 3 - Verify configuration path

  * Double check that ``/etc/loom/conf.loom`` is the active configuration

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ update-alternatives --display loom-conf

  * If not, run the following to update it

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ update-alternatives --install /etc/loom/conf loom-conf /etc/loom/conf.loom 20

* 4 - Upgrade Loom packages

  * If upgrading from file, follow the instructions at :doc:`Installing from File </guide/installation/index>`
  * If upgrading from repository, follow the instructions at :doc:`Installing from Repository </guide/installation/index>` and replace the ``install`` on each command with ``upgrade``

* 5 - Upgrade database table schemas

  * If you are using MySQL, make sure MySQL is running and update the table schemas

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ mysql -u loom -p loom < /opt/loom/server/config/sql/loom-upgrade-tables-mysql-0.9.8.sql

  * If you are using another external database, you will need to perform the table changes, manually
  * If you are using the embedded Derby database, the schema update will be performed in the next step

* 6 - Upgrade internal data

  * Run /opt/loom/server/bin/upgrade-0.9.8.sh to migrate data in the database.

* 7 - Start Loom services

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-server start
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-ui start
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-provisioner start

0.9.6 to 0.9.7
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* 1 - Login to the Loom UI as admin and click "Export" to export a JSON file containing:

  * Hardware Types
  * Image Types
  * Providers
  * Services
  * Cluster Templates

* 2 - Stop Loom services

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-provisioner stop
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-ui stop
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-server stop

* 3 - Stop Database and take a backup

  * The embedded Derby database and ZooKeeper server are stopped when Loom Server is stopped
  * If you are using another database, such as MySQL, follow your standard procedures for backing up the Loom database
  * If you are using the embedded Derby database or ZooKeeper, perform the following
     * Replace ``/var/loom/data`` below with the location from ``loom.local.data.dir`` in ``/etc/loom/conf/loom-site.xml`` if you have modified it from default

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo cp -R /var/loom/data /var/loom/data.backup

* 4 - Verify configuration path

  * Double check that ``/etc/loom/conf.loom`` is the active configuration

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ update-alternatives --display loom-conf

  * If not, run the following to update it

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ update-alternatives --install /etc/loom/conf loom-conf /etc/loom/conf.loom 20

* 5 - Upgrade Loom packages

  * If upgrading from file, follow the instructions at :doc:`Installing from File </guide/installation/index>`
  * If upgrading from repository, follow the instructions at :doc:`Installing from Repository </guide/installation/index>` and replace the ``install`` on each command with ``upgrade``

* 6 - Start Database and import schema (Optional)

  * If you are using MySQL, start the service and update the schema

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ mysql -u loom -p loom < /opt/loom/server/config/sql/loom-create-tables-mysql.sql

  * If you are using another external database, you will need to perform the table changes, manually

* 7 - Update JSON with new layout

  * Continuuity Loom |release| modified the JSON layout for Automator and Provider plugins, this updates them

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ /opt/loom/server/bin/loom-0.9.7-upgrade.rb -f export.json -o upload.json

* 8 - Start Loom Server

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-server start

* 9 - Register Loom Provisioner plugins

  * The Loom Provisioner plugins registration informs the Loom Server how to interact with the plugin

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-provisioner register

* 10 - Start Loom UI

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-ui start

* 11 - Import new JSON

  * Login to the Loom UI as admin and click "Import" and select ``upload.json`` from your local machine

* 12 - Start Loom Provisioners

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/loom-provisioner start
