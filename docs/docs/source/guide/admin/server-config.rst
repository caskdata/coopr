Configuring the server
----------------------

Loom server uses Zookeeper for task coordination and a database for persistent data. The server will work out of the box
without any configuration options with an in-process Zookeeper and an embedded Derby DB; however, we 
strongly recommend that administrators supply their own Zookeeper quorum and database outside of Continuuity Loom for performance and
maintainability. Below we indicate how you can supply your own database (in this case MySQL server) for storage, 
and the associated JDBC connector in the server configuration file.

Zookeeper
^^^^^^^^^
The zookeeper quorum, a collection of nodes running instances of Zookeeper, is specified as a comma delimited list of ``<host>:<port>`` (e.g. ``server1:2181,server2:2181,server3:2181``).

Database
^^^^^^^^
Continuuity Loom uses JDBC for database access. To provide your own database, and for Continuuity Loom to access it, you must specify a driver, a connection string,
a user, and a password, as shown in the following example.  We also recommend specifying a validation query to be used with jdbc connection 
pooling.  The query will change based on which database you are using.

    </property>
  </configuration>

Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^
The Server can be configured to run callbacks before any cluster operation begins, after an
operation succeeds, and after an operation fails. By default, no callbacks are run. Out of the
box, the Server supports sending an HTTP POST request containing cluster and job information to
configurable endpoints. You can also write your own custom callback and plug it in.
See :doc:`Cluster Callbacks </guide/admin/callbacks>` for more information on how to write your own custom callbacks.

To enable HTTP POST callbacks you must specify a url to send the request to.  There is a configuration
setting for the url to use on start, success, and failure of a cluster operation. If a url is not given,
no request will be sent. By default, a request will be for every type of cluster operation, but the Server
can be configured to only send the request for certain types of cluster operations by providing a comma
separated list of operations in the configuration. An example of configuration settings is shown below.
::

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="configuration.xsl"?>
  <configuration>
    <property>
      <name>server.callback.http.start.url</name>
      <value>http://host:port/start/path</value>
      <description>URL to send POST request to at the start of a cluster operation</description>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>server.callback.http.start.triggers</name>
      <value>cluster_create,restart_services,stop_services,cluster_configure_with_restart</value>
      <description>comma separated list of cluster operations that will trigger the HTTP POST call</description>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>server.callback.http.failure.url</name>
      <value>http://host:port/failure/path</value>
      <description>URL to send POST request to if a cluster operation fails</description>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>server.callback.http.failure.triggers</name>
      <value>cluster_create</value>
      <description>comma separated list of cluster operations that will trigger the HTTP POST call</description>
    </property>
  </configuration>

With the configuration above, a HTTP Post request will be sent to http://host:port/start/path before the start of every 
CLUSTER_CREATE, RESTART_SERVICES, STOP_SERVICES, and CLUSTER_CONFIGURE_WITH_RESTART operation. If no triggers are given, 
the request is sent before the start of every cluster operation. Similarly, a HTTP POST request will be sent to 
http://host:port/failure/path if a CLUSTER_CREATE operation fails. Since no success url is given, no request is sent when
cluster operations complete successfully. The full list of cluster operations are: 
CLUSTER_CREATE, CLUSTER_DELETE, CLUSTER_CONFIGURE, CLUSTER_CONFIGURE_WITH_RESTART, STOP_SERVICES, START_SERVICES, 
RESTART_SERVICES, and ADD_SERVICES.

     - Number of seconds the server will wait before timing out a provisioner task and marking it as failed.
   * - server.cluster.cleanup.seconds
     - 180
     - Interval, in seconds, between server housekeeping runs. Housekeeping includes timing out tasks, expiring clusters, etc.

   * - server.node.max.num.actions
     - 200
     - Maximum number of actions saved for a node. Oldest action will be removed when actions exceeding this limit are performed on a node.
   * - server.max.cluster.size

The ID generation in a datacenter will start from this number. Each datacenter will need to have a different start number so that the IDs do not overlap. All Loom Servers in a datacenter should share the same value of ``server.ids.start.num``.
   * - server.ids.increment.by
     - 1
     - Along with ``server.ids.start.num``, this setting is used to partition the ID space for :doc:`Multi-Datacenter High Availability </guide/bcp/multi-data-center-bcp>`. The IDs will increment by this number in a datacenter. All datacenters have to share the same value of ``server.ids.increment.by`` to prevent overlapping of IDs. This number has to be large enough to enable future datacenter expansion.
   * - server.callback.class 
     - com.continuuity.loom.scheduler.callback.HttpPostClusterCallback

   * - server.callback.http.max.connections
