==========
User Guide
==========

This page describes the different interfaces and functions that end users can use to manage their own set of clusters within Coopr.
As mentioned earlier in the administration guide, all clusters and nodes within clusters are dictated by templates created by
the administrator, made accessible to individual users (or developers), and displayed in the Catalog. These accessible templates  
are users' blueprint for their individual cluster instantiation.

The User Home Screen
====================
Login to the Coopr UI using your user credentials at ``http://<coopr-host>:<coopr-ui-port>/``.
This will take you to the user home screen, which shows a list of all clusters provisioned by a user. This page displays basic information for each cluster owned
by the user, such as current clusters, clusters under construction, and deleted clusters. Active and deleted clusters, however, 
are shown separately in this interface. Clicking on each of these items launches a separate screen with individual cluster 
description and detailed cluster information.

Provisioning a new Cluster
==========================
Users can provision a cluster by clicking the 'Create' button on the top-right of the screen. Through this page, a user
can create a cluster with a given name and template setting (as defined by the system administrator), and specify the
number of nodes to allocate to the cluster.

For more information on how administrators can set templates for provisioning a cluster, see the :doc:`Administration
Guide </guide/admin/index>`).

Advanced Settings
-----------------

The Coopr User Interface has a number of advanced configuration options.
To access the advanced options, Click on the gray triangle next to the label 'Advanced'. This exposes the options to
explicitly specify the provider and image type to be used for the current cluster. The 'Config' field allows the user
to specify additional custom configurations in a JSON-formatted input (for more information, see
:doc:`Macros </guide/admin/macros>`). In addition, the 'Lease Duration' field allows the user to specify the duration,
in days, hours and minutes, that they want to lease the cluster for.  Services to place on the cluster can also be 
modified from this screen.

    :figclass: align-center

To start creating the cluster, click the 'Create' button at the bottom on the page.

The Cluster Description Screen
==============================
A user can view more details of a cluster by clicking on the cluster name on the Home screen, or by selecting
'Clusters' -> <name of the cluster> on the top-left of the screen. The cluster description page provides an up-to-date
status report of a cluster as well as a description of a cluster, including the template used
to create the cluster, the infrastructure provider, and the list of services installed.

To abort a cluster that is currently being created, click on 'Abort' next to the progress bar on this screen.

Examining and Accessing the Cluster
===================================
On the cluster description screen, nodes are grouped together by the set of services that are available on them.

    :width: 800px
    :alt: Cluster description screen
    :figclass: align-center

To view the individual nodes under each service set, click on the white triangle next to the services. From the expanded
list, a user can obtain attributes about each node, including its hostname and ID. For certain providers, the list may
also show authentication credentials for accessing the nodes, through a service such as SSH.

To view the actions that have been performed on a particular node, click on the 'Show actions' button.

.. figure:: user-screenshot-6.png
    :align: center
    :width: 800px
    :alt: Show actions
    :figclass: align-center

The expanded list shows a list of attributes for each node. These nodes can now be
accessed using the corresponding IP addresses, usernames and passwords (through a service such as SSH).

Deleting a Cluster
------------------
The trash can icon on the top right of the cluster description page deletes the cluster and decommissions the associated
nodes. Clusters that are successfully deleted are moved from the 'Live clusters' list to 'Inactive clusters' on the
user's home screen.

Reconfiguring Services
----------------------
Services can be reconfigured by clicking on the 'Reconfigure' button on the top right of the cluster description page.
Clicking on the button brings you to the reconfigure page. 

.. figure:: user-reconfigure-screenshot-1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 800px
    :alt: Reconfigure cluster
    :figclass: align-center

Click on 'Advanced' to bring up the advanced options. At this
point, though many other settings are shown on the screen, only the config section can be changed. Edit the config as
desired. There is also a restart toggle at the bottom of the page. If restart is on, all cluster services will be restarted
after they are reconfigured. If it is off, all service will be reconfigured, but they will not be restarted. You may have to 
restart them yourself in order for the changes to take place.

Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Services
-------------------------------------------
Services can be started, stopped, and restarted from the cluster description page screen as well. To start a service,
click on the green triangle next to the service name. To stop a service, click on the red square next to the 
service name. To restart a service, click on the white circular arrows next to the service. When a start, stop, or 
restart is performed on a cluster service, service runtime dependencies are examined in order to determine if 
other cluster services also need to be started, stopped, or restarted. For example, suppose service A depends on
service B. A request to stop service B is made. Since service A depends on service B, service A will be stopped
before service B is stopped. Similarly, if a request to restart service B is made, service A will be stopped, then
service B will be stopped, then service B will be start, and finally service A will be started. If a request to 
start service A is made, service B will first be started, and then service A will be started. It should be noted 
that at this time, the system does not track or monitor the status of services. This is why additional starting
and stopping of dependent services may occur. Services can only be started, stopped, or restarted if they are 
in an active state.

Adding Services
---------------
Services can be added to an active cluster from the cluster description screen. Services that can be added are 
services in the template's compatibility list that are not already on the cluster. To add services to a cluster,
click on the 'Add' button and select a service from the drop down menu. Multiple services can be added at once.
After selecting all the services to add, click on the 'Submit' button.

User Profile
============

Users can bring up a user menu by clicking on the button on the very top-right of the screen. This brings up a menu
for editing their profile, bringing up documentation, contacting support, and logging out. Clicking on the profile 
button brings you to a page where you can edit your profile. For the time being, this only contains the ability to 
change the skin of your UI. In the future, skins will be more customizable and additional settings will be available
to edit.
