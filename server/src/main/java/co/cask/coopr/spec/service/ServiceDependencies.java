/**
 * Service dependencies define what a service provides, other services it conflicts with, install time dependencies,
 * and runtime dependencies. See {@link co.cask.coopr.spec.service.ServiceStageDependencies} for a description
 * of what types of dependencies can
 * be defined at install time and runtime for services. Provides is a way for a service to say it satisfies the
 * dependency it provides, and is useful when there are multiple services that provide the same sort of functionality.
 * For example, an admin may create both a "mysql-db" and "oracle-db" that both provide the "sql-db" service. Some other
 * service "app-server" requires a database, but does not care what type of database it is. This allows the admin to
 * configure the "app-server" service to require just the "sql-db" service, which will ensure some service that provides
 * the "sql-db" service to be present on the cluster. A service always provides itself.
 * Conflicts defines other services that cannot be present on the
 * cluster with this service. Real service names must be given here instead of "provided" names. For example, suppose
 * service "myapp-1.0", "myapp-1.1", and "myapp-2.0" all provide "myapp". If another service "yourapp" is configured
 * to conflict with "myapp", it will still be possible for "yourapp" and "myapp-1.0" to exist on the same cluster.
 * Instead, the admin would have to configure "yourapp" to conflict with "myapp-1.0", "myapp-1.1", and "myapp-2.0".
