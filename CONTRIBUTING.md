# Contributing to Coopr

Are you interested in making Coopr better? Our development model is a simple
pull-based model with a consensus building phase, similar to the Apache's voting process.
If you want to help make Coopr better, by adding new features, fixing bugs, or
even suggesting improvements to something that's already there, here's how you can
contribute:

 * Fork loom into your own GitHub repository
 * Create a topic branch with an appropriate name
 * Work on your favorite feature to your content
 * Once you are satisifed, create a pull request by going to the caskco/coopr project.
 * Address all the review comments
 * Once addressed, the changes will be committed to the continuuity/loom repo.

Bugs and suggestions should be made by filing a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/caskco/coopr/issues)
against this repository.
